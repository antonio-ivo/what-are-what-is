# What is `What is` (or `What are`)

`WI` (in short version), is only a joke with words to remember the *"real way"* to be an self-taught person.  
I know it's not only this at the end, but you can make things work with only these questions:

`What is something?` or `What are something?`

Try it!

Knowledge is something that exists all over the world, in everything you can see.
Furthermore, with the [Internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet), knowledge has become more than something you can see, you can have it!
